# AON_Rules_Downloader
The Archives of Nethys is a wiki for the pathfinder game and series of TTRPGs made by paizo.  

This is a downloader for the rules section only and will download the entire rules section.  

Semantic Search chatbot coming soon, check my github to see if it's out yet.

I don't really want people blowing up the AON, so if you don't mind please use the pickle file in the rar archive.  Had to be in a rar archive because of size contraints in github.
